        "Hello, I'm Kevin Xiao. I graduated from Jingdezhen Ceramic University with a bachelor's degree. I have 6 years of frontend development experience and 2 years of full-stack development experience. I am a pixel perfectionist, have a clean code obsession, and prioritize efficiency. Despite working in a small company with an ordinary degree, I managed to earn over 100,000 RMB through side projects introduced by colleagues and my own efforts. After being laid off at the end of last year, I decided to transition to full-time freelancing and established my personal studio on New Year's Day 2026. I welcome any business owners in need to contact me; I am dedicated to serving you.",
