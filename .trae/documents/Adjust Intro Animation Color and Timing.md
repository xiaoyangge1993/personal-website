I will implement the following changes to adjust the animation timing and styling:

1. **Update** **`components/IntroOverlay/index.tsx`**:

   * Change the initial text color from white (`#ffffff`) to the project's primary orange (`#fb923c`) to match the glow effect and site theme.

2. **Update** **`components/Hero/Keyboard3D.tsx`**:

   * Increase the initial delay for the typing animation from `1000ms` to `1500ms`, adding the requested 0.5-second pause before typing begins.
